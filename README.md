#### By _**{Timothy Bourgault}**_

## Description

_{Program Specs:
  -The program does nothing to non-alphabetical characters, since they do not contain any consonants or vowels.  
  -The program adds "ay" to single letter words beginning with a vowel.  
  -For words beginning with 'y', treat 'y' as a consonant.  
  -For words beginning with a vowel, add 'ay' to the end.
  -For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all the consecutive consonants to the end and add 'ay'.
  -If first consonants include 'qu', move the 'u' along with the 'q'.  Don't forget about words like 'squeal' where the 'qu' doesn't come at the very beginning of the word.}_
